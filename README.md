# bicycle-theft-checker

> Google Maps application to check how safe it is to park your bicycle based on bicycle thefts
> within a 1-mile radius of your current location.

This was created for [TotallyMoneys](https://www.totallymoney.com/) HackDay 2021.

The premise being that before you park your bike you check your current location in the app, 
and it will show you bicycle theft hotspot areas and show you the 
perfect location to park your bike based on this data.

- Only shows thefts that have happened during the current month
- Only shows thefts within a 1-mile radius of your current location
